# AI Code Annotator

The AI Code Annotator is a tool that leverages the power of AI language models to automatically generate relevant comments for specific tags in source code. It makes use of the ChatGPT API to interact with the GPT-4 language model.

## Features

- Automatically generates insightful comments for `<comment here>` tags in source code.
- Supports customization through additional prompts.
- Handles large source code files by extracting snippets for annotation.
- Provides progress updates during the annotation process.
- Easy integration with TypeScript projects.

## Prerequisites

Before using the AI Code Annotator, make sure you have the following:

- ChatGPT API key: You'll need a valid API key to access the GPT-4 language model. If you don't have one, reach out to obtain an API key from the GPT-4 API provider.
- Node.js: The tool is built with Node.js, so ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-code-annotator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd ai-code-annotator
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Set the environment variable:

   ```shell
   export CHATGPT_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

## Usage

To use the AI Code Annotator, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your source code files:

   - Place the files to be annotated in the `src` directory.
   - Add `<comment here>` tags in the code where you want comments to be generated.

2. Run the annotator:

   ```shell
   npm run annotate
   ```

   - The tool will prompt you for additional prompts. Provide any specific instructions or prompts to customize the comments generated.
   - The annotator will process the source code files and generate annotated versions with comments replacing the `<comment here>` tags.
   - The annotated files will be saved in the `output` directory.

3. Review the annotated files:

   - Check the annotated files in the `output` directory.
   - Each `<comment here>` tag will be replaced with a relevant comment generated by the AI model.

## Customization

The AI Code Annotator allows you to customize the comments generated by providing additional prompts. When prompted during the annotation process, you can enter specific instructions, questions, or any other text that helps guide the AI model in generating relevant comments.

## Limitations

- Large files: The annotator handles large source code files by extracting smaller snippets for annotation. However, extremely large files may still pose a challenge and may require manual splitting of the code.
- AI model limitations: The quality of the generated comments depends on the capabilities and training of the underlying AI language model. While efforts have been made to improve accuracy, the results may not always be perfect or contextually accurate.
